# Components
This example comes from a real-world situation we hit. The program contains tools for working with "components" on an entity.

Three paradigms are demonstrated:
* Procedural
* Functional
* Object Oriented

In the real-world situation from which this example derives, the OOP version was used. Notice that the OOP version borrows from the functional paradigm by using the `filter()` method on an array.

To see the examples work, use node.js to run them on the command line:

     node functional.js

Or paste the script in your browser's JavaScript console.
